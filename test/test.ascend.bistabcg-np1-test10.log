--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We were unable to find any usable plugins for the PRM framework. This PMIx
framework requires at least one plugin in order to operate. This can be caused
by any of the following:

* we were unable to build any of the plugins due to some combination
  of configure directives and available system support

* no plugin was selected due to some combination of MCA parameter
  directives versus built plugins (i.e., you excluded all the plugins
  that were built and/or could execute)

* the PMIX_PREFIX environment variable, or the MCA parameter
  "mca_base_component_path", is set and doesn't point to any location
  that includes at least one usable plugin for this framework.

Please check your installation and environment.

PMIx_Init failed for the following reason:

  PMIX_ERR_SILENT

Open MPI requires access to a local PMIx server to execute. Please ensure
that either you are operating in a PMIx-enabled environment, or use "mpirun"
to execute the job.

*** An error occurred in MPI_Init_thread
*** on a NULL communicator
*** MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL (processes in this communicator will now abort,

[b09r2n01:2337039] Local abort before MPI_INIT completed completed successfully, but am not able to aggregate error messages, and not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
